##PM2.5 Emissions Data (summarySCC_PM25.rds): This file contains a data 
##frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
##For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a 
##specific type of source for the entire year. 

##Question 5 
##How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 
##1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?

## This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient!
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")
##ran these, it did take a while! 

##Plot 5
MotorVehicles <- grepl(pattern = "vehicle", x = SCC$SCC.Level.Two, ignore.case = TRUE)
VehicleSCC <- SCC[MotorVehicles,]$SCC
VehicleNEI <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% VehicleSCC,]
