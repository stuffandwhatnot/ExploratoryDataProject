For each plot you should

Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file.
Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, 
i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot 
can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file. Only include the code for a single plot 
(i.e. plot1.R should only include code for producing plot1.png)
Upload the PNG file on the Assignment submission page
Copy and paste the R code from the corresponding R file into the text box at the appropriate point in the peer assessment.

Question 1

Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot 
showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
